## Technical Details

### Migration Process
1. **Schema Migration**: Previously completed using Prisma migrations
2. **Data Export**: Extracted data from Neon database using PostgreSQL client

4. **Data Import**: Imported data into Supabase with foreign key constraints disabled
5. **Sequence Reset**: Updated auto-increment sequences to continue from correct values
6. **Verification**: Confirmed data integrity and completeness

### Special Handling
- **JSONB Columns**: The `distributions` column in `PurchaseInvoice` table required special handling to preserve JSON structure
