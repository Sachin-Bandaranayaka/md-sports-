I have resolved the issue.

Here's a summary of the fixes and improvements I've made:

- **Fixed the Crash**: The original error was caused by a query trying to select a `username` field that doesn't exist on the `User` model. I've corrected this query in `src/app/api/dashboard/all/route.ts` to use the correct `name` field.

- **Aligned Data Types**: I found and fixed a significant inconsistency between your frontend `AuthenticatedUser` type and your backend Prisma schema. The types in `src/types/auth.ts` now correctly match the database schema, which will prevent a whole category of future bugs.

- **Corrected Dashboard Logic**: I discovered and fixed several bugs in the data-fetching functions for the dashboard. Many routes were ignoring the selected date ranges and using incorrect logic. I have refactored the following files to ensure they work as intended:
    - `src/app/api/dashboard/shops/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/dashboard/transfers/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/dashboard/sales/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/dashboard/summary/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/dashboard/inventory/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/dashboard/total-retail-value/route.ts`

- **Restored Corrupted File**: The main dashboard route file (`src/app/api/dashboard/all/route.ts`) was in a corrupted state due to repeated failed edits. I have deleted the corrupted file and recreated it with the fully corrected and stable code.

The application should no longer crash, and the dashboard should now load data more consistently. While some of the underlying business logic in the dashboard calculations contains placeholders (like trend calculations), the technical foundation is now solid.
