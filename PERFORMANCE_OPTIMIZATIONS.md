# Invoice Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented for the sales invoice system.

## Overview

The optimizations focus on improving both frontend and backend performance through modern React patterns, efficient data fetching, virtual scrolling, and database query optimization.

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### Frontend Optimizations

#### 1. React Query Integration
- **File**: `src/hooks/useInvoicesOptimized.ts`
- **Benefits**:
  - Intelligent caching with configurable TTL
  - Background refetching and synchronization
  - Optimistic updates for better UX
  - Automatic error handling and retries
  - Reduced API calls through smart caching

#### 2. Component Memoization
- **Files**: 
  - `src/components/invoices/InvoiceListOptimized.tsx`

- **Benefits**:
  - Progressive data loading
  - Better perceived performance
  - Reduced initial load time

### Backend Optimizations

#### 1. Enhanced Caching Strategy
- **File**: `src/app/api/invoices/optimized/route.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - Different TTL for invoices (60s) and statistics (300s)
  - Cache invalidation on mutations
  - Redis-based caching for production

#### 2. Cursor-Based Pagination
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent pagination performance
  - No offset-related performance degradation
  - Better for real-time data

#### 3. Optimized Database Queries
- **Features**:
  - Materialized views for statistics
  - Parallel query execution
  - Efficient filtering and sorting
  - Reduced N+1 queries

#### 4. Bulk Operations
- **Implementation**: PATCH endpoint for bulk updates
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced API calls for multiple operations
  - Atomic transactions
  - Better error handling

## üõ† Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools react-window react-window-infinite-loader react-virtualized-auto-sizer lodash react-hot-toast use-debounce @types/lodash @types/react-window
```

Or use the provided script:

```bash
npm run install-optimizations
```

### 2. Database Setup (Optional)

For production environments, consider creating materialized views:

```sql
-- Create materialized view for invoice statistics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW invoice_statistics AS
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_invoices,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Paid' THEN total ELSE 0 END) as total_paid,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Pending' THEN total ELSE 0 END) as total_outstanding,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'Overdue' THEN 1 END) as overdue_count,
    AVG(total) as average_invoice_value,
    SUM(total_profit) as total_profit
FROM invoices
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Create index for better performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_invoices_status_date ON invoices(status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_invoices_customer_search ON invoices USING gin(to_tsvector('english', customer_name));
```

## üîß Configuration

### React Query Configuration

The optimized setup includes:

```typescript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
        queries: {
            staleTime: 30000,     // 30 seconds
            cacheTime: 300000,    // 5 minutes
            refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
            retry: 3
        }
    }
});
```

### Virtual Scrolling Configuration

```typescript
// Configurable item height and container height
const ITEM_HEIGHT = 80;
const CONTAINER_HEIGHT = 600;
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Initial Load Time | 2-3s | 800ms-1.2s | 60-70% |
| Search Response | 500-800ms | 100-200ms | 75-80% |
| Large List Rendering | 3-5s | <500ms | 85-90% |
| Memory Usage | High (grows with data) | Constant | 70-80% |
| API Calls | High (frequent refetch) | Optimized | 60-70% |

### Monitoring

- Use React Query DevTools for cache inspection
- Monitor API response times
- Track component render counts
- Measure memory usage in browser DevTools

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From Original to Optimized

1. **Gradual Migration**:
   - Start with the optimized page: `/invoices/optimized`
   - Test thoroughly before replacing the original
   - Use feature flags if needed

2. **API Migration**:
   - The optimized API is backward compatible
   - Gradually migrate endpoints
   - Monitor performance improvements

3. **Component Migration**:
   - Replace components one by one
   - Maintain existing props interface
   - Test each component individually

## üß™ Testing

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Load testing with large datasets
# Test with 1000+ invoices
# Monitor memory usage
# Check virtual scrolling performance
```

### Component Testing

```typescript
// Test memoization
// Verify React Query cache behavior
// Test infinite scrolling
// Validate debounced search
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None - all optimizations are additive
- Original components remain functional
- API endpoints are backward compatible

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (ES2018+)

- Intersection Observer API required for infinite scroll

### Production Considerations

1. **Caching**:
   - Configure Redis for production caching
   - Set appropriate TTL values
   - Monitor cache hit rates

2. **Database**:
   - Create recommended indexes
   - Consider materialized views for statistics
   - Monitor query performance

3. **Monitoring**:

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - WebSocket integration
   - Live data synchronization
   - Collaborative editing

4. **Advanced Caching**:
   - Persistent cache
   - Cache warming strategies

## üìû Support

For questions or issues related to these optimizations:

1. Check the implementation files for inline documentation
2. Review React Query and react-window documentation
3. Monitor browser DevTools for performance insights
4. Use React Query DevTools for debugging cache issues
